Statistics
  
1.  Report the number of NAâ€™s in each column

4.  Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? 
5.  Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
6.  Summary statistics for the ABV variable
7.  Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. You are welcome to use the ggplot2 library for graphs. Please ignore missing values in your analysis. Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.
